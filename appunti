what do we do? measure weak equivalence principle.
why? in the context of neutral antimatter, the gravitational interaction is of high interest, potentially revealing new forces that violate the weak equivalence principle. We measure gravitational interaction between matter (the earth) and anti-matter (anti-hydrogen). Good Point: "If antimatter fell down faster, it would mean the discovery of at least one new force, probably two. If it fell up, it would mean our understanding of general relativity is incorrect", says Thomas Phillips from Duke University.

weak equivalence principle = universality of free fall = in the same field all bodies fall with the same accelelration, the mass and composition are important. nobody tests it for antimatter. AEgIS try to do is with anti-hydrogen, mesuring the time of flight and the vertical displacement by a moire deflectometer. We create antyhidrogen by change exchange among cooled antyprotons and excited (by lasers) positronum. Why don't we use antiprotons? Because they are electrically charged, gravity is weak compared with magnetic forces, we cannot measure it (anti-hydrogen is neutral but tests with it are also difficult). 

positronium: an electron and a positron (anti-electron)

the reaction is: positronium + antiproton = anti-hidrogen (antiproton + positron) + electron
anti hydrogen is accelerated towards moirè deflectometer

what is a moirè deflectometer?
A divergent antiproton beam is thrown toward two subsequent gratings that restrict the transmitted particles to well-defined trajectories (images here: http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140728/ncomms5538/fig_tab/ncomms5538_F1.html). There trajectories are fletted by a force, after there is a detector that show us where the antimatter annihilates, so we can compare the expected trajectories without force with the obtained trajectories.

How to produce antimatter:
we need slow antimatter, because it can be trapped. Protons collide with nuclei inside a metal cylinder called a target. About four proton-antiproton pairs are produced in every million collisions. We separate antiprotons from other matter using magnetic fields. the antiprotons are guidet toward the AD and they become more slow. To study and conserve antiprotons we need to trap them. Trap requires an ultrahigh vacuum. Inside the trap, magnetic fields force the charged antiparticles to spiral around the magnetic field lines, and electric fields confine them along the magnetic axis
